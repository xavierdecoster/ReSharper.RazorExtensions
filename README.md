If you're interested into how this plug-in was built, you can read up about it on my [blog post](http://www.xavierdecoster.com/a-resharper-plugin-to-detect-suspicious-semicolons-in-razor-views).

# Installing the extension

To install this ReSharper extension, you need ReSharper 8 or higher. 

For those on an earlier version of ReSharper, clone this repository and run the build.bat. It will produce a ReSharper 7.1 compatible library as well.
